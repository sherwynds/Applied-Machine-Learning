## Notes
- Most of these projects contain data that is not included in this repository; the relevent Kaggle datasets are included in the notebook
- These projects all depend on the CPSC 330 Course Environment Requirements, available in [this repository](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330)

Credits to Professor Mike Gelbart for creating these assignments, course materials, and being an excellent professor in my journey through Applied Machine Learning
